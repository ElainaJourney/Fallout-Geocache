Given an array/list of integers.
You need to find the largest value and the smallest value in the array.
Finally, you need to return the difference between the two values.

def highAndLow(arr):
    high = arr[0]
    low = arr[0]
    for i in arr:
       if i < low:
          low = i
       if i > high:
          high = i
    return(high - low)
